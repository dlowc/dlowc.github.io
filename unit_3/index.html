			<p>Aloha! I'm Delphi. I love good content, smart marketing, and creative community building. I'm almost always laughing.</p>
			
			<p>Right now, I work for School's Out Washington, a Seattle-based nonprofit that provides services and guidance for organizations to ensure all young people have safe places to learn and grow when not in school. In my role as the Communications & Development Manager, I create all in-house colloateral, manage the website, and manage all fundraising events. Prior to joining SOWA, I was an Account Executive for Communiqu√© PR, a boutique public relations firm. I specialized in strategic and tactical PR planning and execution, business development, and client management.</p>
			
			<p>I'm originally from Maui, so I try to take advantage of everything that Seattle has to offer. When I'm not in the office, you can find me tasting my way through Seattle and its surrounding suburbs, attending a Sounders, Seahawks, or Mariners game, or traveling to a far off land to learn about its culture and traditions.</p>
			
			<p>As of August 2018, I began my quest to change careers and become a developer!</p>
